# **Summary of Development and Progress with PID Controller using Zynq and C Code**

This page is to save and provide the resources and progress made on using a Zynq Processing block for the Zybo Board along with the C code developed for the board. Please be aware this was not a completed Experiment, as we moved away from the Zynq design to the more "ideal" design that does not need to use the Zynq in the design. This is meant as a starting place/where we left off, if one is considering the Zynq Approach.
